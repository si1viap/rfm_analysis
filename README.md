# rfm_analysis

This is a classification of the customers based on frequency, recency and monetary value of their orders.
I first calculated the above values, then I created a legend to assing a score from 1 to 5 in each field using percentiles.
Finally, I found the rfm score based on the previous calculations and managed to cluster clients in one of the following groups:

- Champion: 555, 554, 544, 545, 454, 455, 445.	
- Loyal Customer:	543, 444, 435, 355, 354, 345, 344, 335.	
- Potential Loyalist:	553, 551, 552, 541, 542, 533, 532, 531, 452, 451, 442, 441, 431, 453, 433, 432, 423, 353, 352, 351, 342, 341, 333, 323.
